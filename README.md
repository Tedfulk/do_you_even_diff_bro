# Project Requirements: Do you Even Diff Bro

==========================================

_In the vast landscape of the coding world, where giants like GitHub and GitLab rule the realms, a new sprout emerges from the fertile soil. A code review tool imbued with the wisdom of GPT, designed to illuminate your path to better code. Witness the birth of a new era of code reviews._

## Introduction

The GPT Code Review Tool aims to provide an automated yet insightful review of code changes in Python projects. It leverages the powers of pre-commit, Poetry for dependency management, Git Diff for code comparison, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD, culminating in a poetic symphony of code quality enforcement.

## Core Features

### GPT-Enhanced Review

- Leverage GPT to provide natural language comments on code style, efficiency, and potential bugs.
- Provide actionable insights for code improvement.

### Pre-Commit Integration

- Automatically initiate code review before any commit occurs.
- Customizable rule sets based on project requirements.

### Poetry Support

- Manage dependencies like a maestro conducting a symphony, utilizing Poetry for Python package management.

### Git Diff Comparison

- Not just a shallow look but a deep understanding of changes through Git Diff.
- Highlight line-by-line changes for more nuanced feedback.

### GitHub Actions

- A gatekeeper in the cloud, automatically running reviews on pull requests and commits.
- Configurable through YAML files, empowering you to customize your checks.

### PyPI Package

- Easily installable and shareable as a PyPI package.

## Technical Requirements

### Python Environment

- Python 3.9 or higher

### Pre-Commit

- Latest stable version

### Poetry

- Latest stable version

### GitHub Actions

- Compatible with the latest GitHub Actions API

### Git

- Git 2.32 or higher for optimal Git Diff support

## Functionality

### Initialization

- `init` command to scaffold project settings.

### Review Commands

- `review`: Initiate a full project review
- `review-file`: Review a single file
- `review-diff`: Review code based on Git Diff.

### GitHub Actions

- YAML configuration files for different types of review.

### Custom Rules

- JSON or YAML-based rule definitions.

## Performance

### Caching

- Implement caching of previously reviewed code snippets.

### Asynchronous Operations

- Utilize Python's `asyncio` for non-blocking operations.

## Security

### Authentication

- GitHub OAuth for secure API interactions.

### Input Validation

- Extensive validation checks to mitigate injection attacks.

## Database (Future Consideration)

- PostgreSQL 12.14 for analytics and caching.

## Documentation

- Sphinx-based documentation available as HTML and PDF.

## Testing

- Extensive test suite using `pytest`.

## Error Handling

- Utilize `try/except` blocks in Python and gracefully handle all exceptions.
- Log errors to a persistent storage medium.
